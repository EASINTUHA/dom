    <h1>Question-03:What is event bubble?</h1>
    <p>Answer:Event Bubble means when an event is triggered on an HTML element, it first occurs on that element and then continues to propagate up through all of its parent elements, triggering any event listeners along the way. It can be useful for handling events on parent elements that affect child elements, but it can also lead to unexpected behavior if it not handled carefully.</p>
    <h1>Question-04:What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>

        The reason for using it are given below:
        <br>
        1.When we have a block of code that we want to reuse in multiple places, we can use a callback function to pass behavior into the code, so that it can be customized for different use cases.
        <br>
        2. When we need to respond to user input or other events, we can use a callback function to execute code in response to the event.
